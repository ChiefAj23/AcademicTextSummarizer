## Problem Statement
As a graduate researcher, I must regularly read and summarize voluminous research papers and academic journals. This is a time-consuming and mentally exhausting process. This routine process acts as a hurdle to productivity and slows down the rate of literature review and synthesis of knowledge. To address this issue, I designed an AI-powered summarization tool that employs the latest natural language processing techniques to produce concise summaries from lengthy academic documents. This tool will be helpful for students, scholars, and professionals by automatically summarizing, saving time, and enhancing comprehension.

## 🧠 Model Information

This app uses the `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` model from Hugging Face, which is a distilled version of Facebook's BART model fine-tuned on the CNN/DailyMail dataset for summarization tasks.

### 📥 Downloading the Model Manually (Optional)
If you prefer not to download the model at runtime, you can manually download it and use it locally.

#### Step 1: Download the model
```bash
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6"
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

model.save_pretrained("./models/distilbart-cnn-12-6")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./models/distilbart-cnn-12-6")
```

#### Step 2: Update app code to use local path
```python
model_path = "./models/distilbart-cnn-12-6"
text_summary = pipeline("summarization", model=model_path, tokenizer=model_path)
```

This enables **offline inference** and faster loading time for repeated use.
